A lightweight, cross platform XML configuration file reading library that doesn't use any extra memory unless the client application requests for it. 

To achieve zero memory allocation operation the library maps the file to a memory region and walks the XML tree every time a new node is accessed. XML processing might be a bit slower this way but application memory will not get fragmented.

Memory will only be allocated to handle client application requests. In all cases a preallocated buffer can be provided by the client application to store XML data for further processing.

A separate caching option is available that will create a node tree when a XML file gets opened. As a result node searches will be much faster at the cost of a small amount of memory (less than 16 bytes for every XML node in the file).
